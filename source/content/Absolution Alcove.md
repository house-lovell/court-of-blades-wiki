Absolution Alcove is a gossip house in [[The Silk]]. It sits behind the high streets of the Silk. A traditional entrance from the side street leads patrons to the front half of the Alcove, where guests are seated in private booths  facing a slatted wooden screen. As the spirits flow so too do the rumors as patrons exchange gossip, rumors, and other dealing with the voice on the other side of the screen.

A speakeasy back entrance may be found in an alley by anyone who knows to look for it. A loosely-kept secret knock grants seekers entrance to the other side of the Alcove, where they play the part of the stranger. While there is no formality or role attached to sitting in front or behind the screen, though those wishing to avoid attention tend to use the more discrete entrance.

Sanstra (_watchful, stern, tidy_) and her wife Elanna (_generous, strong, outspoken_) keep the place, and mostly keep to themselves. They don't see it in their interest to meddle in folks' affairs, especially not in the Silk. When the wind whips off the waters of the Silk, Elanna makes a mince pie that warms the soul.
