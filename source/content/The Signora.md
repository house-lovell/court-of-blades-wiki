Tier III

>"The Lady of the Silk and Roses, herself, herself. The Signora is the mistress of
all courtesans and courtiers, the chief of every liftskirt to ply the trade in Ilrien.
With a bevy of enforcers and a ruinous amount of blackmail and covertly gleaned
intelligence, she counts among the most untouchable in the city.
You do not cross The Signora. While few have the occasion, or
cause to do so, there are some in the city that have risked their reputations and
destroyed themselves in their efforts to interfere with, or silence The Signora.
Discretion is of utmost importance to her, so when she burns someone it is
assumed to be justified."
> A Court of Blades, p. 197
