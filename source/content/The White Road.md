>"The White Road begins a mile outside of The Grand Gate and terminates
just within the city walls where all the roads are all paved in stone. It was
built to welcome travelers and remind the world of their standing. The
intricacy of the stonework on any given road in Ilrien is tied to the wealth within
the district, but few roads can rival the beauty of The White Road."
