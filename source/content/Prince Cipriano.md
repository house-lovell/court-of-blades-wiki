Prince Cipriano ("Cip") is the young, bookish figurehead of [[index|House Lovell]]. Cip was thrust into the seat of power after disgrace marred his parents' reputations. A reluctant and reserved leader, Cip has been slow to make the social alliances that The Great Game require of him. Luckily, he has [[The Tell]] to help him.
