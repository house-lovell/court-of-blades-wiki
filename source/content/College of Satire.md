Tier II

>"A school of well-paid and much in-demand truthsayers and jesters. No court
is complete without one. Speaking truth to power, the College places suitable
agents in the households of Princes and Merchants alike. The College of Satire
ensures that no matter how grave the affairs of the day, the crowns of [[Ilrien]] do
not take themselves too seriously.
Reputation: Spies, plain and simple. No one believes these jesters are as simple
as they appear. No one wearing that much greasepaint can be up to any good."
>A Court of Blades, p. 218
