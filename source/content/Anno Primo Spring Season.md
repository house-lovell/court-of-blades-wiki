### Goals

During the Spring of [[Anno Primo]], the [[The Tell]] have made it their ambition to disgrace the leader of another [[Major Houses|major house]]. Additionally, they are attempting to get their figurehead [[Prince Cipriano]] connected with a high standing romantic date.

### Events

During the season, [[The Signora]] wants help connecting the [[Blue Devils]] to a [[Major Houses|major house]]. To achieve this, the [[The Tell]] decided to host a tournament to showcase the Blue Devil's prowess in combat and to make format introductions.

#### Tournament _Primavera_

During Tournament Primavera, [[Dante]] and [[Salvatore]] fight as duelists in the tourney while [[Colette]], [[Celestina]], and [[Emmeline Lovell]] attempt to find ways to ingratiate the Blue Devils and [[House Lovell]] with prominent courtiers in attendance. There is social after party planned.

[[Farid zu-Dosta]] won the tournament defeating [[Giovanni]] of the [[Blue Devils]] in the finals.

An after party was thrown in honor of [[Farid zu-Dosta]] at [[House Lovell]]. During the party [[The Tell]] attempted to thwart the poaching of [[Lucenne]] by [[House Al-Mari]], ally more strongly with [[Valcara]] and the [[Blue Devils]], and set up [[Prince Cipriano]] and [[Arendt Keller]].


#### The Fall of Stars

A few weeks pass and [[The Tell]] plans to infiltrate and disrupt the _La Caduta delle Stelle_ (tr. _The Fall of Stars_) primer showing by the [[College of Satire]]. Several plans are in motion to spoil the event, embarrass [[House Elanda]], and ruin the reputation of the [[College of Satire]]. 

[[Prince Cipriano]] is interested in attending the show on it's premiere night. The Tell are working to secure a private box for the prince, while ensuring there is no space for rival House Elanda dignitaries. 

A stage called [[Teatro Galleggiante]] is being constructed by the College in the Silk for this event. It houses eight private boxes. 

The Tell intend to make the College look undignified by cheapening their wine service.  A delivery of wine from [[The Arborist Guild]] to be made to the theater is intercepted by the daring coterie, and is replaced by a watered down vintage.

Initially everything was going to plan for the coterie, Prince [[Jasper Elanda]] arrived at the start of the second act and was turned away at the gate, many loose lips spilled valuable gossip during the performance, and the wine was truly awful. 

However, at the conclusion of the play a masked figure appeared on stage, accused [[The Brizolatto Family]] of committing heinous crimes, and set of charges on each of the floating platforms holding up the audience. 

Thankfully [[The Tell]] was able to escape the swiftly, sinking theater. Members of [[The Tell]] worked quickly to save other theater goers as well as [[Prince Cipriano]] and [[Arendt Keller]]. [[Jewel]], a member of the [[Broadsheets]] wrote an article about the evening's events. There was one casualty, [[Calliope]].
