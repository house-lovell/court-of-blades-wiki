> "_House Battalia won the freedom of Ilrien with blood and valor.
With strength and honor, they hold it still. They are not naive, or
blind to the games of the Esultare. They see the dance, see through the
lies. What was won at the edge of a sword cannot be stolen by pretty
words. Battalia stands vigilant and unimpressed._"
