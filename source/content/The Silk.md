>"The Silk is the floating world of Ilrien. It comes alive when the sun sets, with
brilliant lanterns and courtesans bustling between locales. Lavish parties are
thrown on the main floors of buildings that are little more than four posts and
an elevated floor once the shutters comprising the walls are peeled back. Quiet
and dimly lit alleys denote the entrances to more discrete establishments. There
is an unspoken rule that no one speaks of anything observed in The Silk; to do
so is considered a serious faux pas."
